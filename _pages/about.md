* I am a Postdoc in the [Department of Bacteriology](https://bact.wisc.edu/) at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu), advised by Asistant Prof. [Karthik Anantharaman](https://anantharamanlab.com/). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://lantaoyu.com/files/lantaoyu_cv.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9e0nrQIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=1&sortby=pubdate)]
* My research interests lie in Marine and freshwater microbiological ecology/Environmental microbiology/Diversity and function of carbon and nitrogen cycling associated microbes/Soil enzymology/High throughput sequencing application on microbial
ecology/Omics-mediated microbial ecology studies/Biogeochemical process related microbial ecology/Microbial evolution/Sulfur-related microbiome research

* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I got my PhD in [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) under Dr. [Ji-Dong Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7hrvvZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

This software enables the prediction of metabolic and biogeochemical functional trait profiles to any given genome datasets. These genome datasets can either be metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) or pure culture sequenced genomes. It can also calculate the genome coverage. The information is parsed and diagrams for elemental/biogeochemical cycling pathways (currently Nitrogen, Carbon, Sulfur and "other") are produced.
